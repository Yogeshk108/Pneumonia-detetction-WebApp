            <h5 class="lh-base">
                A wet cough, which is one that produces mucus or phlegm, may improve with steam. Take a hot shower or bath and allow the bathroom to fill with steam. Stay in this steam for a few minutes until symptoms subside. Drink a glass of water afterward to cool down and prevent dehydration.
                Alternatively, make a steam bowl. To do this, fill a large bowl with hot water. Add herbs or essential oils, such as eucalyptus or rosemary, which may also relieve decongestion. Lean over the bowl and place a towel over the head. This traps the steam. Inhale the vapors for 5 minutes. If the steam feels hot on the skin, discontinue until the skin cools down.

            <h5 class="lh-base">
                This simple remedy is one of the most effective for treating a sore throat and wet cough. Salt water reduces phlegm and mucus in the back of the throat which can lessen the need to cough.
                Stir half a teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water until it dissolves. Allow the solution to cool slightly before using it to gargle. Let the mixture sit at the back of the throat for a few moments before spitting it out. Gargle with salt water several times each day until the cough improves.
                Avoid giving salt water to younger children as they may not be able to gargle properly, and swallowing salt water can be dangerous.

            <h5 class="lh-base">
                Probiotics do not directly relieve a cough, but they may boost the immune system by balancing the bacteria in the gut.
                A superior immune system can help to fight off infections or allergens that may be causing the cough.
                One type of probiotic, a bacteria called Lactobacillus, provides a modest benefit in preventing the common cold, according to research.
                Supplements containing Lactobacillus and other probiotics are available at health stores and drug stores.
                Some foods are also naturally rich in probiotics, including miso soup, natural yogurt, etc.
                However, the number and diversity of probiotic units in foods can vary greatly. It may be best to take probiotic supplements in addition to eating probiotic-rich foods.
